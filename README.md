## Fractal Drawing

#### Description

This is a simple fractal drawing app developed as a project for the C++ course at AGH UST Computer Science 2021/22, which enables the user to draw one of the fractals from the given set:

- Julia Set - $z^2 + c$, with $c$ - parameter given by the user
- Julia Set - animated version $z^2 + \exp{ia}$ where $a \in [0, 2\pi]$ and $r$ is a radius parameter given by the user
- Newton's Fractal - one simple case: $z^3 - 1$
- Mandelbrot Set

#### Usage

Firstly, choose the fractal you want to draw. If it is one of the Julia Sets, the input form is:

- for the standard Julia Set - "re im", where $c$ - parameter: $c = re + im \cdot i$
- for the animated Julia Set - "radius", where $r = radius$

then click `draw` and enjoy ðŸŒŒ
